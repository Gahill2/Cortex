## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Long-term memory (remember, recall, forget, past sessions) → use `@agentmemory-remember`, `@agentmemory-recall`, `@agentmemory-forget`, or `@agentmemory-session-history` after `npm run sync:agentmemory-skills` (see `docs/agentmemory-setup.md`)
- Anthropic official skills (PDF, DOCX, frontend design, MCP builder, etc.) → sync with `npm run sync:anthropic-skills` (see `docs/anthropic-skills.md`); invoke as `@anthropic-<skill-name>` (e.g. `@anthropic-pdf`, `@anthropic-mcp-builder`)
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore

## OpenClaw as primary host

There is **no** OpenClaw-specific wiring in this repository (no `openclaw`, `OpenClaw`, or `.openclaw` references in tracked source). `.cursor/` is **gitignored**, so Cursor rules or model defaults are not shared through git.

**To drive Cortex mainly from OpenClaw:** open this repo root as the working tree in OpenClaw; use OpenClaw’s own docs for browser control, pair-agent, and MCP. Keep the skill routing above as the contract for *which* workflows to run (review, QA, ship, etc.); only the host and skill install path change.

**Skills:** if you use gstack, install or sync the OpenClaw-oriented skill copies where OpenClaw discovers them (upstream gstack ships `gstack-openclaw-*` variants alongside the generic skills; exact paths depend on your install).

**Cursor-only chats:** nothing here auto-selects OpenClaw; use local Cursor user rules or a tracked doc if you want explicit reminders.

## Multi-agent review (team workflow)

Use this when several agents (or parallel chats) touch the same codebase so work gets **reviewed, not only written**.

**Roles (conceptual — can be separate chats or sequential passes):**

1. **Implementer** — ships the feature or fix (focused diff).
2. **Reviewer** — invoke `/review` (pre-landing PR review: SQL safety, LLM boundaries, side effects, structure).
3. **Challenger** — invoke `/codex` in *challenge* mode (or `/Codex` challenge on non-Codex hosts; use the adversarial skill your OpenClaw session documents when OpenClaw is the host) for adversarial “break this” pass.
4. **Integrator** — resolves conflicts, applies only agreed fixes, re-runs tests; human approves ambiguous tradeoffs.

**Order of operations:**

- After each agent’s edits: **Reviewer** runs on the **combined diff** against the target branch (not per-file noise in isolation).
- If Reviewer and Challenger disagree: **human decides**; document the decision in the PR or commit message.
- For large cross-cutting changes: run **`/autoplan`** once up front (CEO + design + eng + DX) so scope is aligned before parallel implementation.

**Quality bar:**

- No merge without at least **Review** (or equivalent human review) on the final diff.
- Optional **Challenger** pass for auth, mail, AI, or anything security- or data-sensitive.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Services overview

| Service | Port | Start command |
|---------|------|---------------|
| PostgreSQL 16 | 5432 | `docker compose up -d postgres` (from repo root) |
| Backend API (Express) | 4000 | `npm run dev:backend` (from repo root) |
| Frontend (Vite/React) | 5173 | `npm run dev:frontend` (from repo root) |

### Running the backend

The backend's `prisma-deploy.mjs` script (runs as part of `npm run dev`) requires `DATABASE_URL` in the shell environment — it does **not** load `.env` itself. Use:

```bash
cd /workspace/backend
set -a; source /workspace/.env; set +a
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="" npm run dev
```

Setting `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=""` is required because the `.env.example` has a Windows path that crashes the server on Linux.

### Auth / login in dev

The app uses **cortex auth** (not the v1 auth). Demo credentials (env defaults):
- Email: `grey@cortex.local`
- Password: `ChangeMe123!`
- PIN: `1234`

The login flow uses OTP by default in the frontend. In dev (no SMTP), the backend returns the OTP code in the API response body (`devOtpCode` field).

### Lint / typecheck / test

- **Backend**: `npm run lint` (alias for `tsc --noEmit`), `npm run test` (vitest)
- **Frontend**: `npm run typecheck` (tsc), `npm run lint` (eslint — pre-existing warnings exist)
- The `firebase-status.test.ts` test expects Firebase credentials; it will fail without them (expected in Cloud Agent).
- The Obsidian vault watcher throws unhandled rejections on the Windows path — clear `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to avoid test noise.

### Seed data

`prisma/seed.ts` references a non-existent `TaskStatus` enum export. To seed, either use raw SQL or invoke Prisma directly with string values (`"TODO"`, `"IN_PROGRESS"`, `"DONE"`).
